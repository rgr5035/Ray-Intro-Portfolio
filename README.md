# Ray-Intro-Portfolio

Homework Summary
For this assignment, we had to create a working introductory site about ourselves with various working links to additional pages. Found within these pages are two other sections of the site, one for a standard portfolio with images, the other, a contact form. In addition to these working live links, we also had to ensure that the site was responsive to all screen sizes, meaning that the site can be easily understood from various media screen sources (phone, tablet, monitor, etc.).

Page Layouts
About Me (labeled in Navbar as 'Robby Ray')
This main page is the seciton where you will find a thumbnail image of myself, with an introductory paragrraph, all wrapped within a container. The use of the grid system was at play, along with some basic formatting to fit everything within a shadowed box. You will see that once the responsiveness shrinks to smaller screen resolutions, the image will then format itself to align on top of the paragraph, for easier readability. The page finishes with a sticky footer found on the bottom.

    Portfolio Page
        This section includes another shadowed box containing various thumbnail images laid out in the grid system. Once the screen shrinks for responsiveness, the images will eventually align on top of one another. Standard column formatting was at use for this page. The page finishes with a sticky footer found on the bottom.

    Contact Page
        This section includes yet another shadowed box with a container utilizing various forms to build a standard contact page. The forms are built within the grid system for First & Last Name, Email, and a section for comments. This section is finished off with a 'submit' button (this button is not a working link as of yet, as the assignment was to only demonstrate how to build the responsive layout of the contact form). The page finishes with a sticky footer found on the bottom.
